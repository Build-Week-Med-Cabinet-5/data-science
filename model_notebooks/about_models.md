### About our models

Amy and I both started creating seperate models to start out and play around with the data.
I created a neural network model and Amy created a natural language processing model.
We decided that her model would be the best fit for this project.
We then went in and started tweaking the model and seeing how to get it to make better recomendations.
After working on and polishing the model we then moved on to building our recomendation function.
